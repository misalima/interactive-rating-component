## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS
- Flexbox
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)(JS Framework) 
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development and Deployment Tool


### What I learned

With this project I had to figure out how to apply the basics of Vue.js to achieve the functionality I needed. By referring to the documentation I was able to use Vue.js directives and state variables to manage the component and swap cards (rating and thank you cards) based on those variable states. So I learned how to work with directives like "v-if", "v-bind", and "v-model". I also learned how to add methods to the component instance, in order to add validation and functionality.

Something else I learned with this project was how to build (for production) and deploy a Vue project with Github Pages. I ran into a lot of errors trying to deploy it from a branch of this repository (I spent all day to achieve it), but after a lot of effort, I finally did it. Although it was frustrating at first, it was a great experience. I'm sure next time I'll remember how to do it. 

### Continued development

This was a basic project, which was useful to start understanding how Vue basic features work. I still want to continue deepening my understanding, and learning more advanced features by building more complex projects. For my next project, I will learn more about Vue routing, and advanced components and props, for example. 

I also feel I need to keep trying to write cleaner code, and to use best practices. 

  

### Useful resources

Aside from the Vue.js guide and Vite.js documentation the video below helped me:

- [Video about deploy vue project on Github (in Portuguese)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aNiTrhKZjA&ab_channel=MinutoJavascript) - This helped me understand how to deploy the project.
